Choosing a service to store data can be confusing and overwhelming for a front-end developer.
What are all these acronyms? Are the Amazon services named strange on purpose? These and many other questions
await your journey into the back-end.


As a front-end developer turned full-stack, I've spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to figure out the backend.
Because the backend is harder to _visualize_, I struggled to understand how the pieces fit together. Luckily, I soon found
out I wasn't alone. There's a support group when confused front-end engineers meet called Twitter.

Consider this article a "choose your own adventure" piece. I'll ask questions about your requirements
and then present a few options. Before we can begin our journey, I must first explain the basics. You can
also jump to the [list of services](/blog/backend#list-of-services) directly.

## Backend Basics

What is this scary place, **the back-end?** You can boil it down to this:

- You need a place to store data ([database](https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/what-are-databases))
- You need a method of retrieving the data ([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface))

As a front-end engineer, you've probably worked with APIs before. They allow you to fetch data from some database, somewhere.
On a long enough timeline, you'll eventually need to build your own API or
work with an existing codebase that has a back-end. This brings us to our first question.

## Do You Even Need a Database?

You need a place to store data, right? Here are some questions to consider:

- Can the data live alongside the code?
- Can the data be tracked with source control?
- Do non-technical people need to modify the data?
- Do you need different levels of access?

If you can store your data with your code in [source control](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/source-control),
you might be fine using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
with [git](https://git-scm.com/) â€“ that's what [this blog](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) uses.
It's also worth mentioning you _could_ use JSON files as a pseudo-database if you fall into this category.

However, you're likely reading this article because **you need a database**. Before we start learning about how you can create
your own backend, you might also consider a low-code solution.

## Low Code Solutions

Since you're a front-end developer, you might be able to utilize a low code solution.
These low code tools are arguably the fastest way to get access to some remote data.

Common examples include [Google Sheets](https://github.com/franciscop/use-spreadsheet) or [Airtable](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-airtable/)
as a database. There are other services that provide an [API abstraction](https://nocodeapi.com/) on a variety of data sources.
