Lately, but finally, I'm starting my _logging_ journey. Something is better than nothing, though I planned to build this site in 2021. My h\*cking distractions constantly diverted me from my route. There is a wist whenever I get distracted; I do something out of my comfort zone.

So Finally, after not sleeping for a day and a night, I developed my blogging site. I used every(not every though) modern technology out there. I tried to make this one super fast, like a flash. It performed great in the "lighthouse" and so many analytics sites.

## Tech Stack:

1. NextJS: React based framework, which is insane.
2. TailwindCSS: Though I never used synthetic sugar frameworks for CSS, tailwind amazed me seriously.
3. MDX: All blog posts are written and will be written in MDX.
4. Contentlayer: It's currently not released fully, but you can try this out from their GitHub repo. It helps me to bundle my MDX into actual data.
5. Supabase: Currently not using but planning to use it for the backend.
   Btw it's open-source.
   Future Target:
6. Rewrite the whole codebase using TypeScript and Remix.
7. Add functionality like reactions or only like, whatever I find best.

## Coming Soon
```js:pages/index.js
console.log('Coming Soon!');
```
